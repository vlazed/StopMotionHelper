Stop Motion Helper
==================
Stop Motion Helper is a tool for Garry's Mod designed to make stop motion animation easier and more manageable.
It can also be used for recorded animation, but it is mainly designed around stop motion.

## Fork Details

This unofficial version of SMH adds:
- Bonemerged entity support
- Frame jumping support
- Smoothing trick concommand
- FPS, framecount, and timeline length convars to save between sessions
- Exit saves
- Bone motion paths
- Entity names when hovered over
- Modifiers for environment editors and volumetric clouds
- Quality-of-life physics-recording indicators
- Audio playback from this [fork](https://github.com/smg4tech/StopMotionHelper)

See this [tutorial](./TUTORIAL_2.md) for more information. These changes are unlikely to be added into the official SMH version. If these changes happen to be included in the official version, I'd recommend migrating from my fork.

### Installation
1. Navigate to your garrysmod/addons folder.
2. Either a) download the zip file and extract the folder or b) open up a command terminal (with Git installed) and execute `git clone https://github.com/vlazed/StopMotionHelper.git`
3. If you did step 2b, execute change directories to the cloned folder (`cd StopMotionHelper`) and `git switch develop`

To stay updated to the latest version of this fork, either a) do step 2a again, or b) open the command terminal in the `StopMotionHelper` folder and perform `git pull`.
