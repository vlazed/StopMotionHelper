Stop Motion Helper
==================
Stop Motion Helper is a tool for Garry's Mod designed to make stop motion animation easier and more manageable.
It can also be used for recorded animation, but it is mainly designed around stop motion.

## Fork Details

This unofficial version of SMH adds:
- Bonemerged entity support
- Frame jumping support
- Smoothing trick concommand
- FPS, framecount, and timeline length convars to save between sessions
- Entity names when hovered over
- Modifiers for environment editors and volumetric clouds
- Quality-of-life physics-recording indicators
- Audio playback from this [fork](https://github.com/smg4tech/StopMotionHelper)

These changes are unlikely to be added into the official SMH version. If these changes happen to be included in the official version, I'd recommend migrating from my fork.
