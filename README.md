Stop Motion Helper
==================
Stop Motion Helper is a tool for Garry's Mod designed to make stop motion animation easier and more manageable.
It can also be used for recorded animation, but it is mainly designed around stop motion.

This unofficial version of SMH adds:
- Bonemerged entity support
- Frame jumping support
- Smoothing trick concommand
- Entity names when hovered over
- Modifiers for environment editors and volumetric clouds
- Quality-of-life physics-recording indicators

These changes are unlikely to be added into the official SMH version. If these changes happen to be included in the official version, I'd recommend migrating from my fork.
